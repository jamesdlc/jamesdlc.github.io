    <p>I realized early that I have a love for working with technology. When I was in 6th grade, my pops gave me a book called "Building and Assembling a Pentium Computer". It taught me a lot of good stuff like phoenix beep codes, how to install Windows 95 through the DOS Command Line, and really how a computer works from the inside out.  I spent countless hours re-imaging and building computers for people. I would always run into several errors during setup but firing up a finished build was so satisfying. For some reason, the challenge of troubleshooting was always fun to me.
      <p>
    I have an in depth background in manufacturing and IT.  I think my experiences make me an ideal developer. Manufacturing taught me how to make things and working in IT taught me how to diagnose, isolate, and resolve issues.</p>
